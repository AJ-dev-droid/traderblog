<h2>What's the site about?</h2>
</head>
<body><p>So many times, as a trader myself, I've met people who have completely misunderstood the concept
        of the market. It's not just about buying low and selling high; it's about understanding trends,
        managing risk, and having a solid strategy in place. And it's certainly not a get-rich-quick scheme.</p>
        <p>Well, this site is
     dedicated to educating users about trading, 
     its principles, and common misconceptions. 
     The goal is to provide clear and accurate information
      to help users make informed decisions.
